## Current Milestone

> A **milestone** solves a set of **core problems** by passing a set of predefined **milestone tests**. 

Here is the current milestone we're focused on:

> **Problem**: Jerry’s are unaware of key resources.
>
> > **Test**: Ask Jerry’s to identify key resources / places.
> >
> > **Passing iff** Jerry can show me where to find everything, and explain what are the most important.
> >
> > Status: **Fail**

> **Problem**: Jerry’s have a hard time finding things.
>
> > **Test**: Ask Jerry’s to navigate to contributor dashboard, a specific teams page, voting, treasury.
> >
> > **Passing iff** Jerry can find and show me how to find anything in the DAO.
> >
> > Status: **Fail**

You can find the full set of **core problems** on the [Product Testing Dashboard]().

## Principles

1. Any proposed feature must solve a **core problem** (see teriminology).
2. A **core problem** must be **proven legitimate via user testing**.
3. A **milestone** complete when it's _milestone tests_ are passed via user testing.
4. **Milestone tests** must be defined before any development or design occurs.

## Workflow

- Sprint planning on Tuesdays at 11am EST.
- Milestone planning happens on-demand.

## Terminology

### Milestones

- A **milestone** solves some set of core problems.

- A **milestone test** is a set of tests that must pass for a release to be considered reached. These usually involve user testing.

- **Milestone planning** is the act of (1) choosing a set of _proven_ problems to solve for, and (2) defining tests to measure if they have been solved.

### Core Problems

- The [**Core problems**]() are an ordered list of problems we're attempting to solve. **Every problem must have convincing evidence of its suggested severity and urgency**. Likewise, **user tests must be shown for a release to be considered ready**.

- The [**Core Problem Dashboard**]() is an explicit list of the problems we're trying to solve, what order we plan to solve them in. Absorb this, question this, know it. This is our map for navigating featurse and priorities.
