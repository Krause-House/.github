## Principles + Process

1. Any proposed feature must solve a **core problem** (see teriminology).
2. A **core problem** must be **proven legitimate via user testing**.
3. A **milestone** complete when it's _milestone tests_ are passed via user testing.
4. **Milestone tests** must be defined before any development or design occurs.

## Terminology

### Milestones

- A **milestone** solves some set of core problems.

- A **milestone test** is a set of tests that must pass for a release to be considered reached. These usually involve user testing.

- **Milestone planning** is the act of (1) choosing a set of _proven_ problems to solve for, and (2) defining tests to measure if they have been solved.

### Core Problems

- The [**Core problems**](https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/1c666b2efe204bec9a847ae56724b7de?v=5c085b44b97e4f41bc133769d687ea8a) are an ordered list of problems we're attempting to solve. **Every problem must have convincing evidence of its suggested severity and urgency**. Likewise, **user tests must be shown for a release to be considered ready**.

- The [**Core Problem Dashboard**](https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/1c666b2efe204bec9a847ae56724b7de?v=5c085b44b97e4f41bc133769d687ea8a) is an explicit list of the problems we're trying to solve, what order we plan to solve them in. Absorb this, question this, know it. This is our map for navigating featurse and priorities.
