## Weekly Personal + Team Retro's August 26th 2022
> I want to make sure all of us are feeling like we're making progress on learning/growth goals outside of our immediate work.
> Reflecting on and articulating them should help us spot changes that need to be made before they fester.  In addition, understanding
> each others' interests/goals should help us help each other.

### Looking to spot cases in which...
- Contributor did not learned something new of significance to them.
- Feel like personal progress isn't being made.

### Personal Retro
1. Did you have the chance to learn anything new this week?  What was it?
2. Do you feel like you're making progress on broader learning goals?
3. What do you want to learn or work on moving forwards?


Eli
1. Learned
  - Learned the hard way that constant communication really matters.  Lot of frustration from folks caused by my not communicating what I've been working on and why.
  - User interviews are an immensely high leverage use of time.  Really understand now to focus in on "process" over "thoughts".  Understand what the user does and why, not what they think.  Establish baselines so we can **measure** what our tools do.

### Team Retro
1. What did we do well?
2. What can we do better?
