### Looking to spot cases in which...
- Contributor did not learned something new of significance to them.
- Feel like personal progress isn't being made.

### Personal Retro
1. Did you have the chance to learn anything new this week?  What was it?
2. What do you want to learn or work on moving forwards?
3. Priorities for the week ahead?

1. Learned
  - Learned the hard way that constant communication really matters.  Lot of frustration from folks caused by my not communicating what I've been working on and why.
  - User interviews are an immensely high leverage use of time.  Really understand now to focus in on "process" over "thoughts".  Understand what the user does and why, not what they think.  Establish baselines so we can **measure** what our tools do.
  - Time well spent is mostly "via negativa" eliminating low-leverage work, and we can do that for each other in these standups via suggestions and feedback
  - Some basic learning of GH action flows and managing permissions / process on PRs
  - Set up analytics on site, am curious to explore this more systematically
 

### Team Retro
1. What did we do well?
2. What can we do better?
