## Weekly Personal + Team Retro's August 26th 2022
> I want to make sure all of us are feeling like we're making progress on learning/growth goals outside of our immediate work.
> Reflecting on and articulating them should help us spot changes that need to be made before they fester.  In addition, understanding
> each others' interests/goals should help us help each other.

### Looking to spot cases in which...
- Contributor did not learned something new of significance to them.
- Feel like personal progress isn't being made.

### Personal Retro
1. Did you have the chance to learn anything new this week?  What was it?
2. What could you have done better?
3. Priorities for the week ahead?


Eli
1. Learned
  - Learned the hard way that constant communication really matters.  Lot of frustration from folks caused by my not communicating what I've been working on and why.
  - User interviews are an immensely high leverage use of time.  Really understand now to focus in on "process" over "thoughts".  Understand what the user does and why, not what they think.  Establish baselines so we can **measure** what our tools do.
  - Time well spent is mostly "via negativa" eliminating low-leverage work, and we can do that for each other in these standups via suggestions and feedback
  - Some basic learning of GH action flows and managing permissions / process on PRs
  - Set up analytics on site, am curious to explore this more systematically
  - Played around with a basic monorepo, that was interesting
 
2. Could have done better...
  - Should have taken time quicker to pair with Trik on a basic first issue, left him hanging a bit
  - More intentional introduction for test users.  I kind of just threw a link at Mario and Lewwwk without much strategy or intention

3. Week ahead
  - People seem to use mobile more than I thought (although it could be mostly for chat).  Either way, I think I'm best focusing on that before introducing new features
  - Implement feedback from user interviews
  - Continue to user test as I iterate
  - Make sure trik gets momentum
  - Learn some cross browser testing, I noticed there were windows layout bugs I can't catch in my machine

Greg
1. Learned
  - Improved on user interviews (lots of practice) which was something I've been wanting to work on for a long time. Hopefully there will continue to be chances to talk with users in the future.
2. Could have done better...
  - Definitely got less productive later in the week with all the drama going on
  - I feel like I'm not adhering to the product team's original vision strictly enough? Are we truly working on the "mission critical" aspects of Krause House?
  - Keep syncs up to date and prepare for standup ahead of time
3. Week ahead
  - I think I'll be doing a fair bit of thinking / writing this upcoming week. We're at a pivotal moment both as a team and as a DAO.
