### Eli
Problems

1. Search tabs don't map clearly enough to problems (USER)
- [ ] map out core problems for search box specifically (add to problem queue)
- [ ] make any relevant changes
- [x] filter questions to top
- [x] add more question resources to FAQ

2. Wasted effort to make every "app" from scratch (DEV PROD)
- [x] build abstracted list from that can accept any list data that maps to a subview
- [ ] get an idea of what we'd want to render so we can build/design around that
- [ ] ~~build instance for "Users"~~

3. PR's on all of Trik's commits will slow him down (DEV PROD)
- [x] setup sprint branch we can push directly to

4. Hard and low-leverage for Trik to bounce around issues
- [ ] find a specific feature he can focus more big-picture on

5. People are lost about roadmap and what to rally around
- [x] sketch new org chart

### Trik
- [ ] (suggestion) * find a feature that you'd be excited to own/deliver

### Greg
