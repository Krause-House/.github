> 2. Prioritize problems.
> 3. Map to tasks.


### Eli
Problems

1. Search tabs don't map clearly enough to problems (USER)
- [ ] map out core problems for search box specifically
- [ ] make any relevant changes
- [x] filter questions to top
- [ ] add more question resources to FAQ, and write necessary docs

2. Wasted effort to make every "app" from scratch (DEV PROD)
- [ ] build abstracted list from that can accept any list data that maps to a subview
- [ ] build instance for "Users"

3. PR's on all of Trik's commits will slow him down (DEV PROD)
- [ ] setup sprint branch we can push directly to

4. Hard and low-leverage for Trik to bounce around issues
- [ ] find a specific feature he can focus more big-picture on

5. People are lost about roadmap and what to rally around
- [ ] sketch new org chart

### Trik
- [ ] (suggestion) before knocking out any issues, add any user/product problems to the HouseOS problem queue
- [ ] (suggestion) get some muscle memory and go wild with sprint branch (solid commit messages still important for now)
