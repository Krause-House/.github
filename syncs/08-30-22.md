Agenda:

- [ ] Checkin with [priority queue](https://github.com/orgs/Krause-House/projects/6/views/1). Edit such that we're all on board.
- [ ] Standups
- [ ] Other thoughts?

## Standups

> 1. Brainstorm problems for the day. Anyproblems yesterday?
> 2. Prioritize problems.
> 3. Map to tasks.

### Eli

Problems

1. Can only focus on nerd shit when traveling

- [x] some fp style refactoring, useful generic react hooks, should iteratively become more idiomatic (focusing on organizing files around types and transformations of those types)

### Trik

1. Don't have a consistent focus, sometimes leaving left over bandwidth
  - [ ] Sync over priority que should help establish a laid out plan
  - [ ] tomorrow check in with eli to get timeline of houseOS features
  - [ ] get timeline for next interview with bmart
 
 2. Dont have info for Pacer's layout to start front end design
   - [ ] make a plan with greg to get definite dates, so that layout wont be a crunch
 
### Greg

1. If we don't consistently align on priorities, we'll fail to stay in sync on team direction

- [ ] priority queue check in
- [ ] send out feedback survey after approved by other team members
- [ ] (if enough responses by EOD) digest feedback from survey and write up conclusions

3. If bayesian can't properly parse the data I provided him, he'll fall behind on generating the report and we might not have it to show the Pacers

- [ ] Assist bayesian where necessary on filtering/compiling data for that report

4. If we don't consistently learn the latest tech, we'll fall behind both as individuals and as a team

- [ ] Sync with Eli on organizing the learning day

- [ ] Final DAO Alerts user interview

## Other Topics / Questions / Concerns

- Eli: would like to have a problem queue specific jam, ideally tomorrow, to get really critical, and organized, about our roadmap
