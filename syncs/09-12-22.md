### Trik



### Eli
Problem: Krause House governance is opaque, multi truth-source, and high implicit, leading to lack of meaningful participation and practical centralization.
- iron on initial kh governance state

## Other
1. Eli: fyi my new proposal might be more steward/governance heavy, and less product-y.
