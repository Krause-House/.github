1. Iterate on personas / product / direction
2. Standup


### Personas, Product, Direction
> Let's decide who are most high priority personas are (and at what point in time) and build for them.

### Team Standup (in priority order)
- Jerry's can't leave comments on proposals
  - [x] toggle wallet / comment / profile features back on (@eli)
- If HouseOS codebase not clean with good utilities, dev pace is slower, and harder for contributors to help
  - [x] refactor and create some more utility hooks (app launcher hook to hide redux dispatches)
