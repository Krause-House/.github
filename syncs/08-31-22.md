# Standup 08-31-22

1. Problem Queue Assessment
2. Standups
3. Other notes / points of order

## Problem Queue Checkin

- Before we even look at the PQ, what are the top three problems you think we need to solve and in what order?
- Does the PQ reflect that? If not, let's change it up
- Ultimately, we want to just rip the top items and solve those for the day.

## Daily Problem Queue

> @greg @trik, let's try one problem queue, and we'll tag ourselves

**We're drifting from problem queue, not super clear what next milestone is**

> Urgent, High leverage

- [ ] host PQ jam as a team, stop all work until problems are ordered and tests are drafted (@team)
- [x] review [month 1 feedback results](https://github.com/Krause-House/.github/blob/main/feedback/Month%201%20Feedback.pdf) (@greg)
- [x] prepare for standup by analyzing current problems + opportunities to solve them (@greg)
- [x] List 3 most urgent problems and solutions (@trik)
- [ ] Share research docs on potential opportunities

Too hard to build over hOS unless you're familiar with it.

> Not urgent, high leverage

- [x] readability refactor session x 2 (@spice)
- [ ] ~~write readme to give people a sense of how to build "apps" (and also to guide a more compehensive refactor)~~ (@spice)
