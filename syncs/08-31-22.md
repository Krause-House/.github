1. Problem Queue Assessment
2. Standups
3. Other notes / points of order



### Eli
Problems queue:

We're drifting from problem queue, not super clear what next milestone is
- [ ] organize PQ
- [ ] host PQ jam as a team


Too hard to build over hOS unless you're familiar with it.
- [x] readability refactor session x 2 (will be doing regularly)
- [ ] write readme to give people a sense of how to build "apps" (and also to guide a more compehensive refactor)
