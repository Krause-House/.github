# Standup 8.22.22

> It might take a few days to iron this out, but I want to make sure we're articulating our problems clearly on a regular basis, and mapping that to tasks.

Agenda:

- [ ] Priority Queue Intro / Ideation (get 2-3 problems up and ordered)
- [ ] Eli does example problem -> task standup
- [ ] Trik probmem -> tast standup

## What problems are we working on?

**How do we plan to work to a solution TODAY (concrete actions)?**

Eli

1. Jerry’s have a hard time finding known resources. Jerry’s are unaware of key resources.

Test

- [x] iterate on milestone user interview
- [x] interview nibblez

Build

- [x] implement changes from trik interview
- [x] house OS mobile view v1 ready to user test
- [x] submit a resource / leave feedback links/forms

2. We're (product team) not clear enough about prioritization of problem space.

- [x] design problem based sprint
- [x] create a priority board to try out

3.  I don't have clear enough data on user interactions that I'm not viewing.

- [x] setup analytics to track most common resources

Trik

1.

## Any other notes / thoughts?
