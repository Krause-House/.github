## Takeways / Problems

House OS

- [ ] Scroll bar on windows on command palette
- [ ] Don't close command palette on opening link
- [ ] Hard to know what a specific resources IS (ex: wtf is the polygon treasury and what is it used for) (maybe use info button hover)
- [ ] Remove Forefront dashboard
- [ ] didn't know scrolling existed
- [ ] Submit a proposal vs. Proposal Database not super clear, maybe consolidate
- [ ] Maybe organize related links, some kind of filtering / grouping
- [ ] Add some file system / Google drive, maybe have stewards give each team a file to act as a source of truth, and make this public
- [ ] Add Discord link

KH In General

- Not comfortable voting no on many proposals, especially when voting weight is insignificant.
- No way to conveniently see accounting / financials of the DAO.
- Feels taboo to ask questions about the DAO and finances.
- No clear, comfortable, path to constructively voice concerns about spending.
- No way to see progress of people being funded.
- No way to know who's being funded for what.
- No way to know if there's fraud on the treasury.
- No way to get info / context on a given transaction.
- Tedious for Stewards to maintain transaction logs.
