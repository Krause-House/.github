**If we could communicate one thing super well, what would that be for you?**

- Current priorities and how community members can tap in.

## Takeaways

**DAO Side Notes / Thoughts / Problems (to add to queue)**

- MyJerry seems like a big deal, but no info on it
- **"I'LL GET TO IT LATER, BUT I NEVER DO"**
- "once people get onboarded, they get lost" - maybe buddy system?
- Discord seems to be where people look for useful links
- Communications
  - "should be a role for a communications person
  - "we fall short on communication...losing people...not consistent comms tools...outside core people feel disconnected / unsure how to plug in"
  - **stewardship call for strategic direction**, core team perspectives, "that's where the meat it"
  - "**checking announcements** pretty much every day, **assuming most important things are up there**"
  - Hard to stay up to date with projects
  - "I want a cool avatar"
  - "podcasts aren't regular for me, because they're not regular"
- DAO Ops Comprehension
  - Backend of treasury / accounting completely unknown to me
- Proposals
  - missed 3-4 that they wanted to vote on
  - vote when I have some influence
  - most interested in "contributor funding requests" and "media-related" and big spendsâ€”not as interested in small proposals
  - summary on proposal would be useful
  - When you say "no" there's no opportunity to say why
  - "should be more going back for rework..more community input", not just stewards
- Everyone has said they dont' like notion

**House OS Takeaways/Solution Ideas:**

- **use announcements for roadmap and project updates and direction**
- not clear that difference between "proposals tab" and "proposals db" and "submit a proposal"
- prioritize commands more dilligently
- could use desktop for "current projects", "get involved", "calendar"
- maybe initially filter by link type, and ditch users / proposals
- add some "get involved", "how can I help"
- windows command palette size is whack
- "House OS" name means nothing to people
- measure average snapshot participation before and after
- Treasuries
  - not clear what each treasury is and why it exists, how do they fit together
  - etherscan not clear/intuitive for everyone
- can't get info without leaving site
- can't see treasury over time
- searched "strategy", "key projects", "roadmap"
