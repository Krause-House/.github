# Trik User Interview Notes

Persona:

- mid-term contributor (4 months),
- technical, but not particularly DAO focused

- Find most things in Discord
- When part time, used Dework
- Now organizing on Trello/Notion Docs/Webflow

**How do you keep track of all those?**

- browser search autocomplete,
- recently bookmark folders
  - "tedious"
  - "have to remember to add things"
- have to scroll back through conversations

**Do you feel you have a sense of the "map" of the DAO? Do you know what places exist? Do you know the edge of the "world map"?**

- "No, 50% sure where to go"
- "Even in Discord, trying to search specific info was difficult"
- Doing dev work, very hard to find stuff that needs to be worked on, even on Dework
- "Don't have a picture of that by any means"

**If I asked you how much resources/assets KH has, and to show me them, how would you go about that?**

(I think he interpreted as links/pages, not treasury assets.)

- "Would start with Discord"
- Usually get info from "announcements" channel (scrolled up there)
- "A lot I want to be involved with...but sometimes lot of friction to try to figure it all out"

**Do you have Krause House Calendar? If not, where would you find it.**

- **Didn't know Calendar existed.**
- **Ultimately couldn't find after 2-3 mins**
- Look in "Start here" section
- Tried Googling, ended up on Krause House site, got confused if the Roadmap was the calendar

**If you wanted to submit a proposal to the DAO, how would you go about that?**

- Couldn't find
- "these are hard questions"
- "I don't know either"
- When trying to find proposals, scrolls through announcements
- Note: announcements seems like a "go to", if people have a natural tendency to head to a "waypoint", House OS will be perfect

**What kind of things can I propose to the DAO?**

- Not sure, but would probably reach out to an Agent
- Found out about Agents through Greg.

**What percent of info do you get from peers / docs+announcements?**

- 80% peers, 20% from Discord and other places like that.

**What kinds of funding streams are open, and what are they funding? Do you feel like you have a sense? Do you care or not?**

- Searching through Snapshot
- "Been very curious, and don't have any way of finding it"
- "Commodore posted something, but I could never find it again"

**If this was your desktop, what would be the icons you use the most?**

- None, would just use search.
