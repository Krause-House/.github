# User Interview

I’m gonna ask you some questions to get a sense of how you navigate the DAO. It’s not a test of you, but more so of Krause House itself.

**Current Process**

Persona

- How do you keep track of resources and links across the DAO? Let's say you were logging on to get some stuff done. Show me what do might do / where you might go?
- What resources or links do you use most frequently?
- What kind of things to you access on mobile, if any?

Tests

- If I asked you to send me the calendar, how would you do that?
- If I asked you to send me the treasury, how would you do that?
- If I asked you to send me info about how governance works, how would you do that?
- Do you know what treasuries currently exist?  Could you send me those?
- Can you show me where to draft a new proposal?
- If I asked you who’s currently being funded by the DAO and for what, how would you find that information out?
- If I asked you who the multi-sig signers were and how that works, how would you find out that information?
- If I showed you a [transaction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4762eacebdb7585d32079fdcba5bb94eb5d76f2), how would you go about checking if it’s legitimate or not?

**Test 1 - Immediately Comprehensible**

_Questions:_

- Are there any resources that you found that you didn’t know about?
- If there anything you use that you couldn’t find here?
- What else might you want to find from here?
- If this was your desktop, what icons would you want on there? Would you use them, would you just use search?
