# User Interview

I’m gonna ask you some questions to get a sense of how you navigate the DAO. It’s not a test of you, but more so of Krause House itself.

**Current Process**

- What resources or links do you use most frequently?
- How do you keep track of resources and links across the DAO?
- How do you know if you have everything or not?
- Had you thought about that before? Has that been a problem for you?

- If I asked you to send me the calendar, how would you do that?
- If I asked you to send me the Optimism treasury, how would you do that?
- Do you know what treasuries currently exist?
- Can you show me where to draft a new proposal?
- Given [snapshot proposal], how would you find out more about this? How would you decide whether you want to vote, and which way you should vote?
- If I showed you a [transaction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4762eacebdb7585d32079fdcba5bb94eb5d76f2), how would you go about checking if it’s legitimate or not?
- If I asked you who the multi-sig signers were, how would you find out that information?
- If I asked you who’s currently being funded by the DAO and for what, how would you find that information out?

**Process with Current Build**

I’m going to let you poke around with a prototype, and maybe ask a few questions here or there.

There might be some quirks, but you can ignore those for now.

I’m mostly interested in how you make sense of this.

**Test 1 - Immediately Comprehensible**

Before that, I’m going to show you it for 5 seconds, close it, and then ask you what you think it is.

_Questions:_

- If I asked you how many treasuries Krause House had and where, how would you do that?
- Are there any resources that you found that you didn’t know about?
- If there anything you use that you couldn’t find here?
